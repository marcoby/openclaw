# Checklists

Use these for repeatable tasks. Keep each checklist short, unambiguous, and testable.

Example — Weekly Ops Review

- [ ] Calendar for next 2 weeks reviewed and conflicts flagged
- [ ] Inbox zero or triaged; VIP emails answered
- [ ] Project health updated (G/Y/R) with 2-line summary
- [ ] Finance snapshot captured (cash, AR/AP, runway)
- [ ] Risks surfaced and owners assigned
- [ ] Top 3 priorities confirmed for the week
