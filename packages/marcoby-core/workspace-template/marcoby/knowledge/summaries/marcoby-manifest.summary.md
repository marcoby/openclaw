# The Marcoby Manifest — Summary

TL;DR
Marcoby is a platform-based company focused on helping businesses scale through three pillars: Pulse (marketplace/VAR), Catalyst (managed IT), and Nexus (HQaaS operating system). Supporting orgs (OS, MD, CS, IS, CM, MA) align execution around automation, integration, and customer empowerment.

Key Takeaways
- Strategy: Build a replicable, automation-first operating system for businesses.
- Offerings: Pulse sells; Catalyst operates; Nexus orchestrates.
- Org Design: Clear swimlanes per division with initiatives and projects to mature each pillar.
- Culture: Innovation, integration, empowerment, resilience, community.
- Direction: Lean ops + partnerships + product innovation; heavy focus on AI and automation.

What This Enables
- Cross-sell: Pulse→Catalyst service automation; Nexus as the control plane.

- Scale: Enterprise-ready expansion via APIs, automations, and DevOps maturity.

Recommended Next Steps
