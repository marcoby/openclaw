# Knowledge Base

Use this area to store company docs and the distilled handbook I learn from.

Structure

- inbox — Raw uploads you drop here for processing
- source — Cleaned originals (as-is)
- notes — Extracted text/markdown versions for search/readability
- summaries — Human- and AI-written summaries and takeaways
- index.yaml — Catalog of documents (title, owner, date, tags, links)

How to import (today)

1. Easiest: Paste text here in chat and say "ingest this as <title>".
2. Upload .md or .txt files in this chat — I’ll file them under inbox/ and process.
3. If you have .docx or .pdf, either:
   - Export to .md or .txt, then upload here; or
   - Paste the relevant content; or
   - Share a public/anyone-with-link view URL and I’ll try to fetch (works only if link is public).

Note: Direct SharePoint/OneDrive private fetching isn’t connected yet. I can set that up later if you want.
