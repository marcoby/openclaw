Marcoby Final Report: Strategic Recommendations & Roadmap
To: Von Jackson, Founder & CEO
From: Fractional COO
Date: January 30, 2026
Subject: Final Recommendations for Offer Restructuring & Scaling to $100k MRR

1. Executive Summary
Catalyst (Managed IT) is the foundation; Nexus (AI & Automation) is the growth accelerant. Pivot the front-door offer to lead with Nexus automations, bundling Catalyst for stability. Differentiate from MSPs by positioning IT as the engine powering automation.

2. Strategic Pivot: Nexus as the Lead-In
- Observation: IT support seen as cost center; Automation/AI seen as investment.
- Recommendation: Market outcomes (automation) and include managed IT as part of the bundle.

2.1 Proposed Offer Structure (3 Tiers)
All tiers include Catalyst + Pulse; tiers differ by Nexus automation count. Services still purchasable à la carte.
- Tier 1: Foundation — SMBs/Solos — 1 custom automation; Core security, remote support, basic M365 mgmt.
- Tier 2: Growth — 5–20 users — Up to 3 automations; Full Catalyst mgmt, onboarding, vendor mgmt.
- Tier 3: Scale — Manufacturing/Established Law — Up to 5 automations; vCIO, compliance, advanced security, priority support.
Note: Charge setup + maintenance for automations beyond included.
Pricing Insight: Good-Better-Best nudges buyers to the middle; top tier anchors perception.

2.2 Optional Future Strategy: Nexus Core (OpenClaw)
- Stage 1: Use White Label Agency for fulfillment.
- Stage 2 (optional): Build internal IP (OpenClaw) by dogfooding; over time, replace simpler automations to improve margins.
- Differentiation: Agency = labor; OpenClaw = intelligence in client env.

2.3 Optional Strategic Application: Digital Labor (long-term)
- Digital L1 Engineer: Ingests RMM webhooks, executes fixes, closes tickets.
- Digital Provisioning Agent: Automates onboarding across M365, Pulse, RMM.
- Digital Research Assistant: Pre-meeting briefings from public data.
Case study: Klarna AI assistant handled 2/3 of chats (~700 agents equivalent).

3. Niche Strategy: Specialized Expertise
Focus niches: Law Firms and Manufacturing.
3.1 Law Firms — Top 5 Automations: Intake→Case file; document drafting; meeting transcription; billing reminders; calendar/docket sync. Validation: Clio Legal Trends Report.
3.2 Manufacturing — Top 5 Automations: Inventory alerts; shift handoff logs; safety incident reporting; vendor invoice OCR→ERP; maintenance scheduling. Validation: McKinsey Digital Manufacturing.

4. Operational Fulfillment & Infrastructure: Dual-Track + Visual OS
- Track 1: White Label Agency — immediate execution; 25% rev share (automations) / 50% (apps). Vendor relationship; no OpenClaw exposure.
- Track 2: OpenClaw — optional internal IP; start with internal dogfooding, gradually replace simple automations.
- Visual Operating System (Miro): Central nervous system linking to OneDrive SOPs. Hybrid dashboard for humans + AI; technical validation by Von required (RMM configs, network, patching flows).
Model: “Hollywood/Flash Organizations” — assemble specialized teams; high agility and margins.

5. Scaling the Team: The Core 5 to $100k MRR
Priority hires:
1) SDR/BDR (immediate) — run SDR playbook; evolve to close Tier 1–2 deals.
2) Support Engineer L1/L2 (critical) — offload Catalyst tickets; free Von for sales/strategy.
3) Full-Time Engineer (conditional) — only if activating OpenClaw/IP.
4) Customer Success Manager — retention, QBRs, upsell automations.
5) Junior roles (contract) — burst capacity 6–9 months.

6. Financial Outlook & Next Steps
- Target ARPU: ~$2,500/mo; ~40 clients → $100k MRR.
- Margins: Variable cost via rev share + high-margin recurring services.
Next 14 Days:
1) Intro to Agency leadership; confirm capacity for Law & Manufacturing bundles.
2) Formalize Agency agreement (25%/50% split).
3) Technical audit of Miro/OneDrive SOPs; correct assumptions.
4) Update website/sales deck: Nexus-first + 3-tier bundles.
5) Launch SDR outreach to Law & Manufacturing using lead list.

Closing Note
Dual-track strategy: Agency for speed/scale; OpenClaw as optional IP play. Miro as shareable interface with AI while protecting data. Sales remains a bottleneck; agency + automation focus is promising given AI-driven market shifts.
