# Final Report — Summary & Calls to Action

Thesis
Lead with Nexus (automation) as the value story; bundle Catalyst (managed IT) as the operational backbone. Use a 3-tier “Good-Better-Best” model to position value, not commodity support. Execute quickly via a White Label Agency; consider OpenClaw as an internal IP track once stable.

What Changes Now
- Messaging: Nexus-first outcomes; 3 bundles (Foundation/Growth/Scale)
- Focus: Law and Manufacturing with prepackaged “Top 5” automations per niche
- Fulfillment: Agency handles delivery now under rev share; you validate the Visual OS technical details
- Hiring: SDR/BDR and Support Engineer immediately; keep Engineer conditional on IP track

Why It’s Smart
- Buyers value automation as investment
- Bundles simplify choice and raise perceived value
- Dual-track reduces time-to-market while preserving future margins via IP

14-Day Action Checklist
- [ ] Intro + capacity check with Agency (Law/Manufacturing bundles)
- [ ] Sign Agency agreement (25%/50% split)
- [ ] Audit Miro + OneDrive SOPs for technical accuracy
- [ ] Update site + deck with Nexus-first + 3 tiers
- [ ] Launch SDR campaign to Law + Manufacturing (use lead list)

Key Numbers
- Goal: ~$2,500 ARPU; ~40 clients → $100k MRR

Risks & Mitigations
- Sales execution bottleneck → Hire SDR now; founder time protected by Support Engineer
- Overreliance on Agency → Dogfood OpenClaw, replace standard automations over time
- Technical drift in docs → Founder-led audit; convert to living runbooks
